# Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a Personal Assistant to be developed on a personal laptop. The Assistant’s primary goal is to automate daily tasks such as summarizing emails, managing calendars, and conducting repetitive actions like web searches, ultimately improving efficiency and productivity.

---

## Problem Statement

- **Inefficient Daily Workflow**: Repetitive tasks (e.g., sorting through emails, scheduling events, or searching for routine information) consume valuable time.  
- **Need for Automation**: Manual, repetitive processes can be accelerated via a multi-agent approach leveraging Language Learning Models (LLMs).  
- **Scalability & Model Agnosticism**: The solution should remain flexible to different LLM providers and seamlessly support future upgrades.

---

## Learning Objectives

- **Multi-Agent Design**: Implement and construct a multi-agent architecture that is model-agnostic, ensuring scalability and flexibility for future enhancements.  
- **Observability & Evaluation**: Establish a standardized framework for monitoring, evaluation, and logging performance metrics of the Assistant.  
- **Development Cadence with Cursor**: Streamline the development process using Cursor’s features, ensuring efficient iteration and version control.

## Core Capabilities

### Intention Detection (Router)
- Design a bot (powered by LLM) that understands user intent from natural language inputs (e.g., commands, questions, tasks), and can route the intent to the corresponding agent to handle the tasks.  
- Ensure it supports advanced LLM models for higher accuracy and context understanding.

### Multi-Agent Execution
- **Email Summarization**: Summarize both read and unread emails, highlighting critical items that require follow-up. This requires secure integration with an email API.  
- **Calendar Management**: Create or modify events in a user’s calendar using an appropriate API.  
- **Translation Tooling (Version 2)**: Provide quick translations for text queries.  
- **Web Information Search (Version 2)**: Offer basic, on-demand web searches for real-time information, e.g., stock market updates, sports scores, or current news articles.

### UI & Interface
- **Phase 1**: Command-line interface (CLI) for quick, text-based interactions within the terminal.  
- **Phase 2**: Transition toward a more user-friendly, interactive graphical UI once CLI-based features are stable.

## Implementation Considerations

### LLM Model Agnosticism
The architecture must abstract away specific model details to allow easy swapping or upgrading of the underlying LLM.

### Observability & Logging
Implement logging and metrics collection to capture user interactions, response times, and overall system performance. Use these metrics to continuously refine the Assistant’s performance.

### Scalability
The system should accommodate increased usage or additional capabilities without a significant performance impact.

### Security & Privacy
Ensure sensitive data (e.g., email content, calendar information) is handled securely, using encryption and proper authentication for APIs.

## Roadmap & Milestones

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) – Command Line Assistant
- Integrate with email API for summarization.  
- Integrate with a calendar API to schedule and list events.  
- Basic CLI-based user interface.

### Enhanced Capabilities
- Add translation tools and intention detection improvements (fine-tuning on advanced LLMs).  
- Implement structured logs and monitoring dashboards to track usage and performance.

### Version 2 – Extended Functionality
- Introduce basic web search integrations (e.g., stock market, sports scores).  
- Expand the UI from CLI-based to a simple graphical or web-based interface.

### Future Iterations
- Incorporate more advanced AI features like voice interaction or deeper integration with additional third-party services.

## Success Metrics

- **Usage Frequency**: How often users invoke the Assistant for daily tasks.  
- **Time Saved**: Reduction in time spent on repetitive workflows.  
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores or subjective evaluations of the Assistant’s performance.  
- **Error Rate**: Frequency of incorrect summaries, missed tasks, or failed searches.
